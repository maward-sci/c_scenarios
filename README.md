# Blue Carbon Restoration Scenarios
## Contents
This repository contains code and documentation for the **Blue Carbon Restoration Scenarios** model.

The model is written in `R` and the associated files are contained in [`model`](./model). To understand more about the model and the various parameters that can be tweaked, head to the [model README](./model/README.md).

Implementations of the model, which are simulations run for various scenarios of interest of the sake of testing hypotheses, are found in [`scenarios`](./scenarios/). These are aiming to be well-documented `.R` files with any function code and fully self-describing `RMarkdown` files implementing the model and whatever additional functional code for the sake of running, visualizing, and analyzing simulations.
