# Blue Carbon Restoration Sceanrios
## Here is how this works
1. Look at the data files
    1. Scenarios Data.xlsx is a file I named with spaces in the name
    1. Scenarios_Data.csv is probably the same but in csv format
1. Look at code files
    1. `scen_generation.R` is probably important
    1. `Scenarios_exploring.R` is also potentially valuable


# Tips
1. The RStudio history is saved here `/Users/<userName>/.rstudio-desktop`
